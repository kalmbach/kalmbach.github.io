hi there!

I am a developer living in Montecarlo, a small city in Argentina (not the one in MÃ³naco).
I write code in ruby and javascript, mostly for SAAS applications, working remotely from my home
since 2007, developing good habits and communication skills with dedication and effort.

Motto: Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.
